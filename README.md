### How it works ?

When you open, save, change tab on file it acts immediately and shows you the color preview by showing a small box besides the color value. 

It is intelligent enough to detect the color on a page. There is no restriction if you are working on a project that has these [Supported Languages](#supported-languages), also if you have decleared colors on your tailwind.config.js
it will automatically detect those colors and show you the preview.
